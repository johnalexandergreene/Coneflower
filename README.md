SALT
----
----

A geometry generation system

Plain old square grid based. No nesting. Integer based. Total cartesianville.
(Which brings its own weird set of limitations and requirements)

#################################
IT IS TWO DIRECTIONAL !!!

It grows via differentiation
AND
It grows via outward growth. Sprouts and trees and vines and such.
(as opposed to Forsythia, which is unidirectional. Only differentiates.)

AND

We can use a mix of hand-drawn jigs (splitters...) and algorithmic jigs (boilers, foamers...). EASILY. Because squares are so easy. (as opposed to nesting kisrhombille, which is complex)

--So ya. It's like Forsythia, except for all that stuff I just said.

THIS MIGHT MAKE A NICE VIDEO
A PROGRESSIVE CULTIVATION VIDEO

From a point grows a rectangle. Maybe awkwardly, the original point becoming a corner point of the rectangle, being drawn from it. IE : The dot extends a line, takes 3 right turns...

Then the rectangle starts differentiating and sprouting. 
All growth is incremental. 
Orifices stretch outward, 
  growing into internal spaces, 
    within which even more growth occurs.

Yes, a very nice video.
  
SO ALL JIG OPS create, not just a transformation... but a series of transformations. One for each stage of growth of the Jig's effect. At each stage we render a frame of geometry, then render the whole composition, thus a frame of video.

=================
ALG 000

create a rectangle or whatever rectangle-based root shape.
select a jig for the prospective cultivation domain (PCD). 
  1) the area within the rectangle AND 
  2) the perimeter line + the surrounding space.

So that gives us 2 jigs. Apply them.

Applying a jig in SALT means creating a series of progressively developed pieces of geometry. A "geometric animation" if you will. Which is then collectively rendered into a frame of actual video.
The number of frames is arbitrary. 
When the frame-creation process is finished the jig is considered done with its work 
and then we are ready for our next jig or whatever.

=================
DECORATIONS
Consider the fancy ways to render rectangular geometry.
We could do textures.
Squares could become circles.
We could do fancy edge waves and zigzags.

=================
CURVE SMOOTHING
It's an option.

=================
STYLES OF OUTWARD GROWTH
0) Total outward growth, like a 360forest growing from a seed. Obvious.
1) A nice funky border, with fat warts or whatever. Nothing huge. Constrained to a nice thickness.
2) Total outward growth constrained to only 1 or 2 edges.
3) Organized outward grown, implemeting some kind of overall strategy for making a particular style of pattern. Basically #1 generalized.

MORE SUCH NOTES

Salt is a shape-grammar system. Similar to but not identical to Forsythia.

It employs Jigs that use the division type of Jigging. 
IT ALSO employs Jigs that use the outward-projection type of Jigging
WE MIGHT ALSO have Merging. That is to say, 2 adjoining shapes Merge to create a new, larger shape.

(So there is some "the world around me" type modelling going on. And patterns will TRAVERSE the map, somehow. I imagine clockwork seafoam.
And that type of modelling is made much easier given that we're working within a square-cell-map, see below. 
Also, we're gonna have a global scale.)

It uses the square-cell-map instead of the kisrhombille (nesting or otherwise).

Our jigs can be created with a drawing tool or progammatically, of course.
