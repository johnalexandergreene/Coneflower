This may not deliver the boiling we are looking for.
Probably going back to a parametric Forsythia jig type thing

But anyway, here are notes

Desirable processes : boiling, smoothing, boiled edge expansion

Maybe pretty textures, like polkadots

REPLACEMENT
Would be reasy. Painting textures. Replacing hex with X. Stuff like that.
