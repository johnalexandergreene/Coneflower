ZCELLSYSTEM

It's a system of cells.
each cell can hold an arbitrary number of presences, each with an arbitrary intensity level
presence is the presence of a polygon. Where is the polygon relative to the cell.
A presence object has 
  a polygon (the polygon that is present)
  a value in range [0,1] (how present) 

If the cell is well inside the polygon then that polygon has presence=1 for that cell
If the cell is well outside the polygon, presence=0? 
Near the edge but inside : 0<presence<0.5
Near the edge but outside : 0.5<presence<1

Thus we render forsythia stuff in terms of zcells

-----------------
LOCAL THICKNESS
------------------

The thickness of the uniformish cell-mass at this cell.
Has nothing to do with the depth of the cell. Just local mass architecture.
We might do like this
  For each cell within... say... 16 layers 
  (that's how we address the local cell, in terms of layers of communication from this cell
  ie : the immediate neighbors (layer0) the next layer of neighbors out (layer1) and so on)
  get the biggest circle that the local mass (BLMC) can contain AND contains the cell. Ge that radius value.
  Take the average of those 16 layers of cells radius values (like 1200 cells or something). That's the local mass thickness : L
  
A lot of logic could be based on L. Logic to control minimum and maximum thicknesses. 

------------------------------------------
EDGE SMOOTHING LOGIC
-------------------------------------------
Get a local population sample. 6 layers of cells (like 50 cells)
get the various summed presences. Change personal presence values appropriately.
Make edge smooth. Stay sharp, no fuzzing out.
